=> Minesweeper Board working correctly
=> Right click toggle facility gives an option for suspecting Mines
=> First click Make sures you dont select a mine and reveals the blocks around it


Update:

tkinter thing not needed as such
Made a 2D array of 16X30
Placed random mines in it
Ishan tu CLI_real_use.py chala ke dekh skta h

ab mai acha heuristic dekh rha hu which can automate this!

time hai abhi

if Sat night tak nhi milta h!
Then we will use the github wala solution

Thanks!
